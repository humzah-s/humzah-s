- 👋 Hi, I’m @humzah-s
- 👀 I’m interested in pretending I understand complex algorithms while secretly Googling everything.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to turn coffee into code, with mixed results.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will make me look smarter than I really am.
- 📫 How to reach me: Just send a message in a bottle, it’ll probably get to me faster than my email response.
- 😄 Pronouns: The Coding Wizard, Supreme Ruler of Bugs.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once fixed a bug by deleting my code and starting over. It worked surprisingly well.
